This an exercise in learning Rust together on stream.
We will do this for one hour on [date tbc], and announce this on the Discord
server and in chat one hour in advance.

## Prerequisites 

* Have Rust installed.

## Format

1. Go over some functionality.
2. Answer questions in the process.

## Goal

To have a basic understanding of Rust and to be able to
create something more than just `hello world`.

## Plan


### Topics we might cover

* project creation
* compile and run (--release)
* variable bindings
* control flow
* match
* functions
* structs
* mutability / references / &ref / *deref
* loops / while
* traits
* lifetimes
* IO
